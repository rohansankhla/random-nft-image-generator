# Random NFT Image Generator

This program generates a random NFT based on user-inputted images.
To use it, please input the paths of each .png file attribute image into its respective list. Then, run the program!

Notes:
- The program is currently designed for image combinations with 3 attributes, but this can be adjusted by increasing the number of arguments in the
  "generate_art" function, increasing the number of attribute lists, increasing the number of foregrounds and paste-methods in the "generate_art"
  function, and continuing to add values after a, b, & c in the "name = main" section
- If you would like the program to generate a new/unique combination everytime its run, please add the "Already Generated Code" to its
  repective list to avoid recreating that combination
- This program only creates new image combinations for NFTs and does not create any metadata
